Basic Codes

This repository is a collection of fundamental programs and algorithms that I've been working on since the beginning of my coding journey in college. These include simple yet essential coding concepts that have helped me develop a solid foundation in programming. Now, as a Senior Developer, I realize the importance of sharing knowledge and contributing to the developer community, which is why I've decided to make this repository public. Whether you're just starting or revisiting core concepts, this repo aims to serve as a helpful resource for developers of all levels.
